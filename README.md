# AdaptiveSeamCarving
A sophisticated image processing tool implementing dynamic seam carving techniques to resize images while preserving important features. This repository includes an advanced approach to seam carving that combines multiple energy maps, including edge energy, saliency, depth, and entropy, to optimize the resizing process.
